TicTac Toe is a simple, fun, and interactive game built in Java that brings a modern touch to the classic game we all know and love. Designed with both play and learning in mind, it offers a smooth and engaging experience whether you're playing solo or with a friend.

When you launch the game, you're welcomed by a clean and inviting start screen where you can enter your name and choose how you'd like to play. You can go head-to-head with a friend in two-player mode or take on a basic computer opponent that offers a light challenge. Instead of generic symbols, the game lets you personalize your experience by entering your name, making each move feel more like your own.

Gameplay is straightforward and user-friendly, with a responsive interface that makes it easy to focus on strategy. If you want to play another round, there’s no need to restart the program just click the restart button and jump right back in. This small feature adds a lot of convenience, especially for quick rematches.

TicTac Toe is more than just a game — it's also a great example of Java programming in action. It’s perfect for beginners who want to see how Java handles logic, user input, simple AI behavior, and interface design, all within a short and enjoyable project.

So whether you're here to sharpen your skills or just have a little fun, TicTac Toe is ready when you are. Enter your name, pick your opponent, and enjoy the game!
